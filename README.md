# BeFake

## Project Overview

BeFake is a new take on social media that can be considered the ying to BeReal's (A new surging social media platform that encourages users to post what they are doing at random times.) yang.
The reason for this is instead of posting what the user is actually doing, they will be prompted to post what they wish they were doing or where they wish they were. Much like BeReal users will be asked to submit a front facing camera
and a back facing camera picture to truly capture the situation they wish they were in rather than where and what they are actually doing. As the website is not a phone app it will not be capable of sending notifications to the users phone
requesting a post during the day. Instead, when the user attempts to make a new post they will be asked to fill a "backlog" of scheduled posts they missed, or they can opt to skip a previous days posts. This will allieviate the issues of not being a phone application but also give the users time to make their pictures as fake as possible. The purpose of this project is to allow users to live out their dreams through the BeFake platform and hopefully someday realize their dream vacations or become inspired from their friend's dream vacations. The application will use a combination of Python/Django for most of the backend data and Vue/Javascript for most of the frontend work. 

## Features
